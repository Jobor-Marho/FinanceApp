Basically when i started this project a I made some installs.
- I Installed create-react-app with:
-> npm install create-react-app

- I Setup my project directory with:
-> npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
where "frontend" is the name of my directory "--template typscript" is the temaplate I Wanna use. In this case typescript.

- Ran my project using:
-> npm start


Then I also installed some modules inorder to integrate the ability to consume APIs. One was Axios:
-> npm install axios --save  &&
-> npm install --save-dev @types/axios

Also installed a module for handling my env data:
-> npm install dotenv --save
