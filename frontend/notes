I used Vite

Basically when i started this project a I made some installs.
- I Installed initialized the project with:
-> npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react-ts

where "frontend" is the name of my directory "--template react-ts" is the temaplate I Wanna use. In this case typescript.

- Ran my project using:
-> npm run dev


Then I also installed some modules inorder to integrate the ability to consume APIs. One was Axios:
-> npm install axios --save  &&
-> npm install --save-dev @types/axios

Also installed a module for handling my env data:
-> npm install dotenv --save

I installed uuid  for integrating assigning unique key for item in map object
-> npm insatll uuid

I installed tailwind css(v.4.1.7) for integrating styling
-> npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

Installed react-router-dom( since the project is a web app)
-> npm install react-router-dom
